This repository contains a versatile stopwatch implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how each component contributes to the stopwatch functionality:

HTML: Defines the structure of the stopwatch interface. It includes display areas for minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, along with buttons for starting, stopping, resetting, and recording laps.

CSS: Styles the stopwatch interface to ensure it is visually appealing and user-friendly. It focuses on clarity and intuitive design for ease of interaction.

JavaScript: Manages the stopwatch logic:

Start and stop functionality: Controls the timing of the stopwatch to accurately measure elapsed time.
Reset functionality: Allows users to reset the stopwatch to zero.
Lap feature: Records laps during stopwatch operation. Each lap records the current elapsed time, providing a log of timings.
Display updates: Updates the interface in real-time to show current time and list of recorded laps.
To use the stopwatch, open index.html in your web browser. You'll see the stopwatch interface with buttons to start, stop, reset, and record laps. Start the stopwatch to begin counting time, stop it to pause, and reset it to zero. Use the lap button to record laps during operation, creating a log of timings for reference.
